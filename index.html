        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business ManagementðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Patrick Ly is a student at University of California, Riverside working on his pre business degree. He plans to major in business management using his various experience in leading people starting at an early age and continued throughout his adolescent year.<br><br>

        At an early age of 7, Patrick has been in scouting for about 11 years of his life. Learning how to lead a group of people is one of the major things he was taught throughout his years in scouts. To show his accomplishments in scouting, Patrick Ly has achieved the highest rank attainable, for a 18 year old scout, the eagle award. This award is for dedicated scout members that have completed all 7 ranks of scouting, completed and led a construction project that gives back to the community.<br><br>
        I know from experience how difficult it is to lead a group of people. I personally have a wide range of experience with working with different people of all ages in the various positions I experienced in a patrol troop. This ranges from quartermaster, treasurer, secretary, to the troopâ€™s leader. As a patrol troop leader, I had the responsibility of teaching the younger scouts about the ways of scouting and delegate patrol positions within the patrol troop. <br><br>
        As a secretary of the troop I was tasked with taking attendance of all the members of the group every week. Keeping tabs on who is here, who is late, and who is absent. After words I would need to upload the data online in the troopâ€™s spreadsheet record. Additionally, I had the task of taking tabs on who is going to what scouting event and, communicating with the treasurer, on who has paid the money and who has not. Also as secretary I was more hands on with the troop overall since I will be training to become a leader later on.<br><br>
        As a leader of the patrol troop, I had to teach the functions and the inner workings of each position. Along with being a leader of the patrol, I was responsible that each personnel were doing their jobs correctly and I had the attend weekly council meetings as the representative of my troop. If there were any errors or any difficulties, I would be the person to come in and help with the issues. Overall the leader is to help develop the other positions, so that they become leaders in the future.<br><br>
        Along with being a leader in Boy Scouts, Patrick gained some leadership experience during his high school years. In marching band, Patrick was elected as the tuba section leader and was tasked with leading the tuba section. As a section leader, Patrick was tasked with keeping the tuba section up to standards, making sure they have been practicing every week, is the section playing their parts correctly, and providing assistance if necessary. <br><br>
        As a section leader, I also have to practice and improve his own performance as a musician myself. I just have more responsibilities since I am their leader and am required to attend weekly council meetings to decide what the entire band plans to do for the upcoming events such as parades, field shows, and fundraiser events.
